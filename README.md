# Sino-Korean Numbers Testing Facility

## Project Info

This is a small tool to generate random numbers.
Sounds boring, right?

You are tasked to translate it into sino korean numbers. Why? Because I think memrise is not a great tool for studying numbers.

For error reports or feature requests, please open an issue.

The app should be available as a [GitHub Pages](https://ketzu.github.io/korean-numbers/) page.

## Auto Translate

This feature takes your keyboard layout and inputs hangul as if you were using the [Dubeolsik hangul layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#/media/File:KB_South_Korea.svg).
As I implemented this mapper, it has probably an insane number of bugs.

Deactivate it if it's annoying, but then you probably have to install a korean language pack for your os or at least a korean keyboard layout.
